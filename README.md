# GTA Solo Session Maker
## Introduction
Have you ever experienced this wierd thing where everyone in your session just leaves at the same time? Yeah me too. This happens more if your NAT type is strict. We can take advantage of this.

## How does this program work?
This program blocks a few ports in your Windows Firewall for 10 seconds.

## OS Support
Only tested on Windows 10 but *SHOULD* work on Windows 8 and 8.1 as well.

## Is it safe to use? Can i get banned?
Yes i'd say it's safe. R* would have to monitor ALL of your firewall rules and make sure you can't modify any of them while GTA is running to get you banned.

## How do i know it's not a virus?
Unless you know the basics of C, you'll just have to take my word for it. If you're intrested. The source available code is here on github.

## Windows protected my PC.
This is becasue it's not signed with a valid certificate. An app certificate is quite complicated to get for such a simple app like this.

## Legal
R* owns the right to the logo and Grand Theft Auto (GTA) trademark.
